# music-genre-classification
<p>This project is part of a research I made when in CBD Indonesia.<p>


<h2>Music genre classification using convolutional neural network.</h2>
<p>Uses CNN Keras model, train test split, to genre classify audio spectrograms into Rock, Pop or Jazz.</p>
<p>Goal is to compare 0-30s and 30-60s spectograms in order to identify which data gives a more accurate classification.</p>

<hr>
<p>data for the spectrograms and csv files will be coming up by the end of October.</p>
<p><strong>M test 2.ipynb</strong> contains the source code.</p>
<p><strong>Spectogram.ipynb</strong> is the revised (credits to Gibran from CBD Indonesia for the assistance with the model training and display of result)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Model still has to be trained on a faster computer or on a server.</li>
</ul>
