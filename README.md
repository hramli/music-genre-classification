# music-genre-classification
This project is part of a research I made when in CBD Indonesia.

Music genre classification using convolutional neural network.
Uses CNN Keras model, train test split, to genre classify audio spectograms into Rock, Pop or Jazz.
Goal is to compare 0-30s and 30-60s spectograms in order to identify which data gives a more accurate classification.


data for the spectograms and csv files will be coming up by the end of October.
Music test.ipynb contains the source code.
Spectogram.ipynb is the revised.
