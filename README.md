# music-genre-classification
Music genre classification using convolutional neural network.
Uses CNN Keras model, train test split, to genre classify audio spectograms. 
Goal is to compare 0-30s and 30-60s spectograms in order to identify which data gives a more accurate classification.

annotation.csv is an excel file containing data to the respective audio spectograms in file spectogram_final.
the zip file for spectogram_final is coming up by the end of October.
Music test.ipynb contains the source code. 

This project is part of the ML research for CBD Indonesia.
