# music-genre-classification
This project is part of a research I made when in CBD Indonesia.


<h2>Music genre classification using convolutional neural network.</h2>
Uses CNN Keras model, train test split, to genre classify audio spectrograms into Rock, Pop or Jazz.
Goal is to compare 0-30s and 30-60s spectograms in order to identify which data gives a more accurate classification.


data for the spectrograms and csv files will be coming up by the end of October.
M test 2.ipynb contains the source code.
Spectogram.ipynb is the revised (credits to Gibran from CBD Indonesia for the assistance with the model training and display of result)

- Model still has to be trained on a faster computer or on a server.
